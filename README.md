## How to build:

You can build this project like any other cmake project (on linux you can use `build_linux_version.sh`), but for the project to build successfully, the sfml library must be installed (You can download it from [this site](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/), for windows it must be installed in the project root directory in a folder named `SFML-2.5.1`, for linux it must be installed in the project root directory in a folder named `SFML-2.5.1_for_linux`) and googletest must be installed (You can download it from [this](https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/v1.13.0.zip), it must be installed in the project root directory in tests/googletest-1.13.0). (if you build through the `build_linux_version.sh`, then all the necessary libraries will be installed automatically)
