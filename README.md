# Game_Mix

## How to run:

run exe/Game_Mix

## How to build:

You can build this project like any other cmake project (on unix systems you can use `build.sh`), but for the project to build successfully, the sfml library must be installed (You can download it from [this site](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/), it must be installed in the project root directory in a folder named `SFML`) and googletest must be installed (You can download it from [this](https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/v1.13.0.zip), it must be installed in the project root directory in tests/googletest). (if you build through the `build.sh`, then all the necessary libraries will be installed automatically)
